My class sold out tonight with over 40 people attending. If you were there, thank you so much! It’s really rewarding to have an engaged audience where nobody even moved when Brad came in to mention that it was already 8pm and that class was free to go as I was running way late (I was on day 2 of week 1 an hour and a half into it).

Slides are [here](http://www.slideshare.net/dblockdotorg/060-in-startup-technology).

Temple of Gravity was built at Burning Man 2003.

The cool git check-in animation was made with [Gource](http://code.google.com/p/gource/).

The Russian hovercraft video is [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDd9vlnqRuo).

Please share your comments and suggestions here or privately at _dblock[at]dblock[dot]org_. I really want to hear from you, please don’t hesitate to contact me for anything. Finally, thanks to [Foursquare](https://foursquare.com), [10gen](http://www.10gen.com) and [Postling](http://www.postling.com) for many data points mentioned in the slides.
