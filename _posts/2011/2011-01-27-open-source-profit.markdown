I answered 7 distinct questions from 7 different people about implementing [Waffle](https://github.com/dblock/waffle) this morning. Most are non-trivial configuration issues, but that’s not the point.

If seven new people are asking questions, this probably means that 70 people are trying Waffle right now. This probably means that 700 people have tried it in the last month. This probably means that 7 million people are hitting web pages behind Waffle. This probably means that waffle performs 7 billion logins a month (on every HTTP request). This probably means that every person on earth is connected to a person using Waffle by at the most 2 degrees of separation! According to my calculations it’s going viral like Facebook.

Is my math okay?

I have project page views to confirm my theory. The Y axis has been cropped out accidentally.
