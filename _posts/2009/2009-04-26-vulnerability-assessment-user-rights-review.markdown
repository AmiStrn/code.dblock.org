I rarely blog about [my real job](http://www.appsecinc.com). But this is way cool if you're a nerd in the database security and vulnerability assessment field - you know, the software that helps protect you from people stealing your credit card information by walking out with gigabytes of data from a `SELECT * FROM CreditCardInfo`.

Anyway. We just announced User Rights Review at the RSA conference and have a technology preview shipping to our select customers now. It's the tip of the iceberg that my team has been working on. Basically the software lets you take a database user account and find out his effective privileges, and vice-versa. Sounds simple? This is way more cool than you think and very challenging to implement.
