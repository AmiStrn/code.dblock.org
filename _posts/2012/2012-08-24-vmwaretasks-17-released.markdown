The VMWare SDK, specifically VixCOM, offers a rich set of programmable interfaces that enable developers to drive virtual machines programmatically with an asynchronous, job-based programming model. Unfortunately that turns out to be too complicated for most scenarios where developers want to use a simple object-oriented interface for common VMWare virtual machine automation tasks. The VMWareTasks is a commercial-grade library that implements this simple interface and makes programming against virtual machines a no-brainer.

This release adds full support for VixCOM 1.11 and is the first release off Github.
