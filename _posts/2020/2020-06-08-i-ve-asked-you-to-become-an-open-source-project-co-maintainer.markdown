If you made any significant, high quality, contribution to one of my open-source projects, and have a decent contribution history on Github, I will ask you to join as a co-maintainer. In some ways, this ask is a non-automated, higher touch, softer implementation of the [Moya Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/Moya/contributors).

You will typically get the following note.

> Thanks for the contribution! Would you like to help out with project maintenance? Maybe make the next release?

For Ruby projects I may add a note along the lines of _drop me an email with your rubygems username/email_.

Some examples of this in [grape#1803](https://github.com/ruby-grape/grape/pull/1803#issuecomment-433619949), [open-weather-ruby-client#20](https://github.com/dblock/open-weather-ruby-client/pull/20#issuecomment-638265068), [iex-ruby-client#63](https://github.com/dblock/iex-ruby-client/pull/63#issuecomment-593147832), [slack-ruby-bot-server#95](https://github.com/slack-ruby/slack-ruby-bot-server/pull/95#issuecomment-472461133), [mongoid-history#202](https://github.com/mongoid/mongoid-history/pull/202#issuecomment-344092634), [strava-ruby-cli#5](https://github.com/dblock/strava-ruby-cli/pull/5#issuecomment-639440785), and [mongoid-scroll#20](https://github.com/mongoid/mongoid-scroll/pull/20#issuecomment-373012494).

### Why do I ask?

My goal is to reduce bus factor, and completely work myself out of the maintainer job, especially if I am the only one on record. Adding maintainers distributes workload, and gives opportunity of ownership to a new person that is likely more motivated than me - after all, you've just made a significant contribution! In the best case scenario I'll be able to step back from being the point-person on a project. The worst case is that you will make a release, saving me a little bit of time.

Some of the best examples of when this worked well include [Michael Herold](https://github.com/michaelherold) becoming the de-factor owner of [Hashie](https://github.com/hashie/hashie), a top 100 most popular Ruby gem, and [Daniel Widdis](https://github.com/dbwiddis) taking over [Oshi](https://github.com/oshi/oshi), the now-default mechanism for Java projects to obtain OS and hardware information natively.

### What are the expectations of a new maintainer?

In short, _none_. I have no expectations, except not to break things on purpose, help out by sharing some responsibilities, and add more people, especially if I get run over by a bus. You can just be a backup plan. Therefore, I do not expect you to spend any of your time on any of the projects, except if you want to. All my asks are nice-to-have's, time permitting.

* Make releases whenever it feels like it, often self-interested when you need one.
* Review other people's pull requests, merge, reject and comment.
* Pay attention to new issues or questions, comment, resolve, discuss and steward any discussion.
* Engage future active contributors as maintainers.

### Why should you say "yes"?

I think you should say "yes" to joining any well-maintained open-source project as a co-maintainer. Aside of giving back to the community, OSS maintenance is a great learning opportunity. A large part of my own career was been built around work on open-source, mostly on projects that I didn't start, including Ruby Grape and Hashie. There's nothing to lose, and a lot to gain in terms of personal and professional development.
