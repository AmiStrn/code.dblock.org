I had a great conversation with Aliaksandr Astapenka and Pavel Paulau about open-source on [CTOCast #6](http://ctocast.com/post/109134364183/ctocast-6-daniel-doubrovkine-artsy-net). It's in Russian. CTOCast подкаст о технологиях, процессах, инфраструктуре и людях в IT-компаниях.

*Update*: that podcast is no more, trying to get a copy of the files.
