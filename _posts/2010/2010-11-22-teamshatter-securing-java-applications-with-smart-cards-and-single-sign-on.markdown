I recently wrote [an article for TeamSHATTER.com](http://bit.ly/cu1F2n) that is a shameless plug for [WAFFLE](https://github.com/dblock/waffle/), aka a short introduction to implementing Windows single-sign-on in Java. It takes an interesting angle on smart cards and tells a real story about a very large customer, which is now getting rid of passwords altogether. As a bonus, you get a somewhat blurry webcam video of me doing a 1-minute demo - [http://bit.ly/cu1F2n](http://bit.ly/cu1F2n "http://bit.ly/cu1F2n").
