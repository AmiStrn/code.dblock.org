Another fine open-source contribution from [@aaw](https://github.com/aaw), [mongoid_collection_snapshot](https://github.com/aaw/mongoid_collection_snapshot): easy maintenance of collections of processed data in MongoDB with the Mongoid ODM.

This turned out to be extremely useful in many map-reduce scenarios where we do lengthy computations that output data that is used as a complete and consistent set. For example, calculating average prices across ranges of items (the example in the documentation). Another good use can be for tags stored as arrays of strings â€“ you want to know how many items are tagged with a given entry. We can now take [my incremental tag count map-reduce](/improving-tags-mapreduce-with-mongodb-18x) and replace it with a much more trivial implementation that uses this gem.
