We all have wish lists. Here’s the deal. Contribute to any of these open-source projects and I will help you in any way I can.

- [CiJoe](https://github.com/defunkt/cijoe): a build tool. I’d like to see [live progress](https://github.com/defunkt/cijoe/issues/66) implemented. Keep it simple, Sam.
- [Heroku-bartender](https://github.com/sarcilav/heroku-bartender): a deployment tool for Heroku. Pickup [any feature request](https://github.com/sarcilav/heroku-bartender/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=open).
- [Gem-licenses](https://github.com/dblock/gem-licenses): an open-source license generator. I’d like to see [licenses matched by a real algorithm](https://github.com/dblock/gem-licenses/issues/1).

#### But, I have no experience!

This is how you get some.

#### This is Ruby. I’ve never done that!

Even better. A lot of very strong developers that I know write Java, C++ or C# by day and would like to try Ruby for the first time. Bored with the tutorial? Don’t know where to start? Here you go. This is a chance to experience the elegance of Ruby, building something people actually want. Procrastinating at your corporate job? This is your chance.

#### Who the hell are you and what can you do for me?

I run engineering in a small [NYC startup](https://artsy.net). I’ll try to help you in any way I can.

- I’ll be happy to spend some technology-related face-to-face time.
- I can introduce you to entrepreneurs, tech leads, hiring managers or, if everything else fails, a decent recruiter in the New York area.
- I’ll invite you to visit [GeneralAssemb.ly](https://generalassemb.ly) for happy hour and maybe even try to hire you for [artsy](https://artsy.net/).
- I can be your reference. This will make a huge difference if you don’t have any real job experience and are finishing college next year.

#### So, you want free labor?

Yes, I do. Well, I can easily pay someone to build these features. But they are all nice-to-have’s and we have a lot more work than we can chew.

#### I have a Wish List Too!

Maybe this can become contagious? List your 3 open-source projects wish-list on your blog and link it in comments!
