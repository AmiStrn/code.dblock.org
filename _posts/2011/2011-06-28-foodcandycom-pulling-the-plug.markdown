In February 2006 I wrote: "I am going to work on foodcandy.com full time for a bit ...". I spent three months at a café on the Lower East Side building the site. It was the second food social network online as far as I know. The same month I lost a bet to my friend Dan at [Biznik](http://biznik.com), the latter got 300 users, first. FoodCandy then had some amazing press, including [Gothamist](http://gothamist.com/2006/07/13/food_tech.php), USA Today, [Slashfood](http://www.slashfood.com/2006/07/12/foodcandy-friendster-for-foodies/), [New York Magazine](http://newyork.grubstreet.com/2006/10/foodies_flock_to_networking_si.html), HaAretz, Bon Appetit and the Times of India. I was even interviewed on the radio. In the meantime I got a full time job, thinking that I’ll be able to continue building on the early successes of the site on my copious free time. It worked for a while, at its height in 2007 FoodCandy had 200’000 unique visitors and over two thousand registered users. The truth is I failed to capitalize on this early success, failed to find a business partner and couldn’t pull it off by myself. Eventually FoodCandy just became my pet project and finally it fizzled.

I want to thank the 3432 registered users for your patronage during all those years. It’s time to pull the plug.

I am selling the site for scraps on FlippA. Click [here](https://flippa.com/2619946-foodcandy-com) for the listing, there have been a few decent bids and it expires soon. Here’s what you get.

- foodcandy.com
- foodcandy.net
- babyfoodcandy.com
- babyfoodcandy.net
- dailyfoodcandy.com

You can have the software, the data and even the server if you would like. I think it’s a great opportunity for someone who wants to create an online media presence for a business of food.

#### Update (2015)

I ended up selling FoodCandy to a British company. I am no longer affiliated with it.
