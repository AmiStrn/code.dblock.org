I gave a talk yesterday at the [Flatiron School](http://flatironschool.com) about the interviewing and hiring process for Engineers at [Artsy](http://artsy.net) and beyond. This focuses primarily on explaining to juniors, ie. engineers who are about to enter the tech job market and has some useful elements for career changers.
