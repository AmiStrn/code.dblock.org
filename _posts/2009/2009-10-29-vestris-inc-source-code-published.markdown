In the spirt of winding down the rest ofÂ Vestris Inc., I've published the source code for all of the commercial software.

- [Base C++ Library](https://github.com/dblock/baseclasses)
- [aGNeS BBS](https://github.com/dblock/agnes)
- [Alkaline Search Engine](https://github.com/dblock/alkaline)
- [XReplace-32](https://github.com/dblock/xreplace)
- [Expression Calculator](https://github.com/dblock/excalc)

The code is not free unless used for non-commercial use. If you plan to use any of this in a commercial application you need to obtain explicit rights to do so from me.
