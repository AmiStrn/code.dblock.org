I made a Slack bot called ["Slava"](https://slava.playplay.io/) using [a more organized and cleanup version of the code that auto-publishes runs from Strava](/2018/02/17/auto-publishing-strava-runs-to-github-pages.html). If you use Slack at work, get your Strava on and help your colleagues get motivated.
