I had a telecom professor in college that said "Euuuuh" every other word during lectures. It was impossible not to notice, and I couldn't focus on the content anymore. So I counted the "Euuuuh"'s to pass time. The record sat around 150 "Euuuuh" per hour.

Fast forward to 2020. My speaking and writing have both significantly improved since I joined AWS. I am more concise, making arguments in fewer words. I've worked hard on replacing opinions with data. But while I have made progress, I've also become more allergic to the worst offenders in weasel and filler words in conversations with fellow Engineers, starting with "like".

> At 33% this spline is, **like**, poorly reticulated.

I'm fuming. Instinctively, I start counting the "likes". I no longer pay attention to the content.

So how do you tell an otherwise very competent Engineer to avoid saying "like"? Just telling them has not always been effective - they quickly agree, try to swipe it under the rug, and do it again. Thus, I devised a better approach.

People that say _like_ a lot will do it often. I choose to wait for a particularly successful meeting that the individual runs, compliment the content presented, and recommend an improvement around _public speaking_ that is not exclusively centered on the weasel or filler word itself, explain why, and offer myself up as a former public offender.

This was a multi-dimensional, complex problem, and you did a tremendous job spelling out the technical options for the group with well-researched supporting data. The solution you came up with was solid.

I recommend working on improving your public speaking in the following areas: 1) you should be able to speak with a lot more confidence 2) you really, really need to cut filler words such as "like" out. The last one is really dumb, but important.  Every time you add "like", you dilute an otherwise on-point message.

So far I've sent a version of this advice to a dozen people. Everyone responded positively. I have noticed a lot of progress in the team to weed "likes" out. I really like it!
