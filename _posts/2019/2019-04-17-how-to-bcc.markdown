In his 2001 memoir "How to Lose Friends & Alienate People" Toby Young proposed a universal theorem.

> Some people are lucky enough to stumble across the right path straight away; most of us only discover what the right one is by going down the wrong one first.

He may have been talking about one of my former colleagues who made a career limiting move by hitting _Reply All_ to a team re-org announcement and saying out loud what everybody already thought: _"I cannot believe you have promoted that idiot."_

The corollary of Toby Young's theorem is that _you should never write anything you don't want to be read_.

That said, such incidents can be avoided with a bit of discipline from the e-mail senders, described below.

### Always Bcc and Announce Lists

Only put individual e-mail addresses on the _to:_ or _cc:_ lines and _bcc:_ mailing lists. Maybe even address the e-mail to yourself to keep a copy. This prevents the knee jerk _Reply All_ reaction to a wide distribution list when one only meant to reply to the sender.

Furthermore, a recipient doesn't know who is being bcc-ed or whether they were e-mailed directly or were part of a list, therefore the polite thing to do is to tell them.

{% highlight txt %}
From: me
To: me
Bcc: team, hr
-------------

Team (team@ and hr@ on the bcc),

Today I am happy to announce that Alice was promoted.

-Me
{% endhighlight %}

### Forward Instead of Bcc

If you are trying to bcc someone as an FYI, don't. Forward that e-mail with a personal note.

A bcc is not an FYI, and you are hiding the fact that another person is being bcc-ed, creating an opportunity for an unpleasant surprise when that person hits _Reply All_ to visible recipients.

From: me
To: Bob

Bob, FYI, here's the team announcement from this morning.

### Move People to Bcc

If someone made an introduction, thank them and move them to the bcc. Spare their inbox from conversations they dont't care about.

From: me
To: Bob
Bcc: Alice
----------

Thanks Alice, moving to bcc. Nice to virtually meet you, Bob.

Daniel meet Bob!

-Alice
{% endhighlight %}

Did someone not follow the rules above? Move everyone to bcc when replying all. You might save someone's professional relationship.

### Say Congrats on the To Line

When replying to a piece of good news, don't _Reply All_. Make it count by sending them something personal and sparing everyone else.

From: me
To: Alice

Congrats Alice, you've done a tremendous job. This is well deserved!

-Daniel
