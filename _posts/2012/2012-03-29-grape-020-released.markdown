After almost a year of active development with 200+ commits, Grape 0.2.0 has finally been released. It’s the code from the "frontier" branch that we’ve been using in production for quite a while.

Grape is an API DSL. If you’re building a RESTful API today, this is a great place to start. Grape lives at [https://github.com/intridea/grape](https://github.com/intridea/grape).

Here’re the 0.2.0 highlights:

- Vendor-based versioning
- Model exposures presentation layer
- PATCH and OPTIONS HTTP methods
- API description blocks, reflection and introspection
- Modules
- Cookies
- Anchoring

Grape is a great project. It’s always an honor to contribute to systems written by much stronger Ruby developers. Many of my pull requests would get rejected and [Michael](https://github.com/mbleigh) would then rewrite the feature with a much improved architecture (API modules is one of those). I feel like I really learned something in this process. Open-source FTW!
