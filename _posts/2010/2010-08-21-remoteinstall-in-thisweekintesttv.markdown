One of my projects, [RemoteInstall](https://github.com/dblock/remoteinstall), was mentioned in ThisWeekInTest.tv, episode 2. It’s a recorded discussion between Ariel Raunstein and Roy Osherove on the subject of test. Roy sang a nice song at InfoQ. I am surprised they don’t have a hookah, some tea and hummus on the show.

#### Update (2015)

Seems like ThisWeekInTest.tv is no more.
