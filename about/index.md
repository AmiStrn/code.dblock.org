Hi! This is my tech blog.

Here's an official bio.

> Daniel Doubrovkine (aka dB.) is Head of Engineering at <a href='https://artsy.net' target='_blank'>Artsy</a> in New York. He maintains multiple popular open-source projects, including <a href='https://github.com/intridea/grape' target='_blank'>Ruby Grape</a> and <a href='https://github.com/intridea/hashie' target='_blank'>Hashie</a>.
