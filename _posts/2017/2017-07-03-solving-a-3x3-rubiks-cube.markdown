I've taught many people, including my 8yo and a whole bunch of co-workers, how to solve a Rubik's Cube. Since then, he has claimed @rubikscubegod on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/rubikscubegod/) and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBVi4JjxGD3dbYlM168ew1g), and him and I recorded a tutorial video. In the video we use [this 1-pager]({{ site.url }}/images/posts/2017/2017-07-03-solving-a-3x3-rubiks-cube/cheat-sheet.pdf). Print yourself a copy.

## Teaching to Cube

Most can figure out how to solve one side and even the first row by themselves. Then it gets harder.

### Solve One Side

Teach how to solve one side, starting with a cross (the +) and then doing edges.

I typically show how to move a cube into the right position by doing a simple turn, then by "saving" (or rotating) correctly placed cubes to the opposite side. When a cube is on the opposite side, i.e. at the bottom, I show how to move it to the side first, then how to place it in the right position.

I let my students practice on their own, until they can easily solve one side.

### Solve the First Row

Teach how to complete columns above the centers, then how to complete the entire first row (aka the T's).

I typically bring a piece down from the top row, rotate it towards its destination, overshoot by one, then bring the piece occupying the target position down and rotate everything backwards.

I let my students practice on their own, until they can have one full side and all the T's.

### Solve the Second Row

Place the cube "opposite" to its destination and follow the following algorithm. There're two versions, from left-to-right and from right-to-left.

### Solve the Third Row

Flip the cube and look at the unsolved bottom patterns and apply one of the following algorithms.

If you get stuck, try the "tower" algorithm.

### Solve the Last Position

When the cube is almost solved, place the full sides on the bottom and on the right and apply the following algorithm to rotate the last 3 cubes.

Sometimes you must do this twice. Sometimes you don't have a full side and must do it three times.
