I _heart_ Github and its magical green merge button. The entire fork/pull/merge workflow has been singlehandedly responsible for a massive amount of open-source contributions by making it so easy! I wrote a quick post on how Art.sy uses Github to build Art.sy on the new Art.sy Engineering Blog, [here](http://artsy.github.com/blog/2012/01/29/how-art-dot-sy-uses-github-to-build-art-dot-sy/).
