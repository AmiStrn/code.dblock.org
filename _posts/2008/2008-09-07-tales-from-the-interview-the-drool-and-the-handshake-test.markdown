I feel very inspired by [Raymond Chen](http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/)'s [The Old New Thing: Tales from the Interview](http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/09/05/8925556.aspx) posts, so here's one from my own.

There're two criteria often omitted in an a successful software developer candidate: doesn't drool and has a handshake. The second one is particularly important, it eliminates potentially weak candidates that can't make a decision. To which the following story ...

We had a candidate come in for a mid-level developer position. We do Microsoft-style interviews on competencies where you start by coding "reverse a string" and end up designing a new thread-safe memory manager for a pocket device with 640K of RAM. So I have this developer who can reverse a string in sleep, reverse-engineer a driver on a week-end and design and implement a large scale system in a week. Needless to say that after four technical interviews of an hour each, we're convinced that we have a hire. So we send in a top-level manager to "sell" the job. The manager gets out of the room and says: _"The candidate is fine, but has no handshake, I got a hanging hand and I didn't know what to do with it!"_ We laughed and ignored that comment. We send a VP person into the room to close the deal, confirm that the only problem is the handshake, and after three minutes the candidate says something in the lines of _"I don't want to answer any more questions, I am tired and I'm leaving!"._ Makes a scene and leaves. Wow. That's a way to not get a job.

We have since standardized handshake testing in the first round.
