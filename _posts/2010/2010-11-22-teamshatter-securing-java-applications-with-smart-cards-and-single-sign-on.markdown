I recently wrote an article for TeamSHATTER.com that is a shameless plug for [WAFFLE](https://github.com/dblock/waffle/), aka a short introduction to implementing Windows single-sign-on in Java. It takes an interesting angle on smart cards and tells a real story about a very large customer, which is now getting rid of passwords altogether. As a bonus, you get a somewhat blurry webcam video of me doing a 1-minute demo.
