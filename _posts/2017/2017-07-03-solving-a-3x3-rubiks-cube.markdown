I've taught many people, including my 8yo and a whole bunch of [coworkers](https://www.artsy.net/life-at-artsy), how to solve a Rubik's Cube. I think it's easy to do with an instructor and very hard to do from Youtube videos. Below is a _curriculum_ for instructors that know how to solve the cube and want to teach a friend.

Most can figure out how to solve one side and even the first row by themselves. Then it gets harder.

### Solve One Side

Teach how to solve one side, starting with a cross (the +) and then doing edges.

I typically show how to move a cube into the right position by doing a simple turn, then by "saving" (or rotating) correctly placed cubes to the opposite side. When a cube is on the opposite side, i.e. at the bottom, I show how to move it to the side first, then how to place it in the right position.

I let my students practice on their own, until they can easily solve one side.

### Solve the First Row

Teach how to complete columns above the centers, then how to complete the entire first row (aka the T's). 

I typically bring a piece down from the top row, rotate it towards its destination, overshoot by one, then bring the piece occupying the target position down and rotate everything backwards. 

I let my students practice on their own, until they can have one full side and all the T's.

### Solve the Second Row

Place the cube "opposite" to its destination and follow the following algorithm. There're two versions, from left-to-right and from right-to-left.

### Solve the Third Row

Flip the cube and look at the unsolved bottom patterns and apply one of the following algorithms.

If you get stuck, try the "tower" algorithm.

### Solve the Last Position

When the cube is almost solved, place the full sides on the bottom and on the right and apply the following algorithm to rotate the last 3 cubes.

Sometimes you must do this twice. Sometimes you don't have a full side and must do it three times.

### Complete Instructions

Print out [my 1-pager]({{ site.url }}/images/posts/2017/2017-07-03-solving-a-3x3-rubiks-cube/cheat-sheet.pdf) with the above instructions starting from the second row! Hand them out.
