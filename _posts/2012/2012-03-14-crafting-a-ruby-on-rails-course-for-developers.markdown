Today I gave a talk to a packed NYC.rb about [crafting a Ruby-on-Rails course for developers](http://www.meetup.com/NYC-rb/events/46696902/). I’m working on a blog post about classroom education, but in the meantime, here’re a few links.

The Open-Source Curriculum @ [https://github.com/generalassembly/ga-ruby-on-rails-for-devs](https://github.com/generalassembly/ga-ruby-on-rails-for-devs)

[Slides from the Presentation on SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/dblockdotorg/crafting-a-rubyonrails-course-for-developers)

#### Demo Stashboards, Students’ Projects

- [https://github.com/jameslin101/stashboard](https://github.com/jameslin101/stashboard): a clean Stashboard clone
- https://github.com/MedText/stashfu: Stashboard as a service
- https://github.com/generalassembly/boardroom: Stashboard with voice-over-ip-activated control

I want to thank the audience for attending en-masse, the students who demoed their Stashboard clones, GA and the course sponsors. Some of the students are looking for a Ruby-on-Rails programmer job, reach out!
