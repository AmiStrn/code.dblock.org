I’ve released the [RemoteInstaller Test Framework 1.2](https://github.com/dblock/remoteinstall). It’s the second open-source release, and I am pleased to see some community adoption. RemoteInstall is a system for automated testing based on VMWare technology and makes it easy to install software and execute tests against it.

The most important features in 1.2 include support for user-defined exit codes, support for rebooting between installers and passing snapshot-specific parameters around.
