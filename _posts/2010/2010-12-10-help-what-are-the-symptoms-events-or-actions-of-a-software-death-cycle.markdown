I am working on a [talk for the DDD meet-up in January in NYC](http://www.dddnyc.org/calendar/15302867/) and could use some help. You’ve certainly worked in at least one project where your gut tells you that it’s going to #fail. But what are the specific symptoms, actions or events that you have encountered that signaled that the project entered a death cycle (spiral, march)?
