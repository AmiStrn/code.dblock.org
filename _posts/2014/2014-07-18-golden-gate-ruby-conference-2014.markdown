I’m very excited to be speaking at [GoGaRuCo](http://gogaruco.com) in San Francisco in September about taking over open-source projects, along with people like [@wycats](http://twitter.com/wycats), [@ultrasaurus](http://twitter.com/ultrasaurus) and [@pat](http://twitter.com/pat). No pressure.

I want to hear about your experiences about taking over someone else’s open-source work! Email me at dblock[at]dblock[dot]org.
