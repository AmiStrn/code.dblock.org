[TeamShatter.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20101125033914/https://www.teamshatter.com/) went live yesterday. SHATTER is the [AppSecInc](https://web.archive.org/web/20131111165225/https://www.appsecinc.com) team that researches database security vulnerabilities and publishes advisories that have been trusted by the industry for many years. For example, Oracle April CPU had CVE-2010-0870 and the July CPU had CVE-2010-0903 and CVE-2010-2373 that were found by Esteban, a team SHATTER member. You can read about some of the team’s most public figures, including (shameless plug), [on the new website](https://web.archive.org/web/20101125033914/https://www.teamshatter.com/about).

I am very excited about this new project because it contains the public information from our entire vulnerability knowledgebase. It’s called the [threat finder](https://web.archive.org/web/20170501211339/https://www.teamshatter.com/threat-finder) and gives you a real live view of the known vulnerabilities each database vendor has acknowledged and fixed. In addition, we’re now publishing a regular feed of information related to data fraud and theft, something we’ve had internally for a very long time. We also hope to include more general articles that talk about security, risk and compliance.
