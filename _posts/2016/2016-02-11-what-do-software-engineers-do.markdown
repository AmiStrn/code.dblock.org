I recently published a blog post on LAB, the Life at Artsy Blog entitled [_"What do Software Engineers Do?"_](https://www.artsy.net/article/daniel-doubrovkine-what-do-software-engineers-do). Its goal is to offer a non-technical perspective to software engineering, using a familiar metaphor of a skyscraper construction project. I hope you find it useful in explaining your job to friends and family!
