I’m teaching [a class at General Assembly on April 20th](http://yourtechnology.eventbrite.com).

_Wednesday, April 20th from 6:00 pm to 7:30 pm._

_This rapid-fire class will take students through the first 60 days of three technology startups. The course will examine the open-source tools, services and cutting edge best practices leveraged by entrepreneurs to set their companies off on the righ foot. Examples will touch on running an engineering team, creating agile engineering processes and hiring. Our three examples are going to be a location-oriented startup with Lift/Scala, MongoDB running on Amazon Web Services, an art-technology startup that develops in Ruby on Rails and runs on MongoHQ and Heroku and a startup that standardizes on the the LAMP stack._

I just went through doing this at [Art.sy](https://artsy.net). We had some good prototypes, but decided to reboot all of technology and restart with a clean slate. I’ve done this a few times before over the last ten years, while setting up new projects or resetting existing ones. But I can tell you that in 2011 the reset looked nothing like in 2001! It’s a whole new world out there. So if you’re an engineer or a technical entrepreneur wanting to see some examples of ‘starting from scratch’ in today’s world of web, this is for you!
