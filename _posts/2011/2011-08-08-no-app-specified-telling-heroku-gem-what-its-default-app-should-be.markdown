On a clean checked out source of some app that deploys to Heroku, I want to be able to type `heroku config`. This complains with  the _'No app specifiedâ€™_ error.

```
No app specified.
Run this command from an app folder or specify which app to use with --app <app name>
```

To fix this, you need to add a remote Git repository for your heroku application and tell the heroku gem to use it as default. Answer found [here](https://groups.google.com/group/heroku/browse_thread/thread/4fc0cc1caa366bfe). Like this.

```
git remote add heroku git@heroku.com:your-app-name.git
git config heroku.remote heroku
```

You can now `git push heroku master` and run `heroku config` without having to specify the app. I often deploy branches, which is `git push heroku branch-name:master`.
