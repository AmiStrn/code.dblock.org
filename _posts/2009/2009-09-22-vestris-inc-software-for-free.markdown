It's 2009 and my first company, Vestris Inc., hasn't existed since 2004. You can read some history [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20090405190145/https://www.vestris.com/sti/company.html). For the anecdote, this is the actual map of Vestris Inc. customers.

It's time to give the rest of the software away for free. I definitely still use XReplace-32 (which remains the best search and replace tool in my opinion) and Expression Calculator (which is the coolest calculator ever :)).

So [get the warez](https://web.archive.org/web/20090404062416/https://www.vestris.com/index-full.html). These are the commercial versions of the software, no limitations and fully featured.

#### Update (2015)

I took the software down and replaced links above with archive.org's. It has been another six years, time to retire these things. You can find the source code for all of this [on Github](https://github.com/dblock).
