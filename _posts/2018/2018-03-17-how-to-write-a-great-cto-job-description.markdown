I don't think I've ever read a CTO job description cover-to-cover. Or seen many good ones. I skimmed over the text, at best.

I get about 5 CTO job descriptions a week. Am I the exception or the norm? I've asked around.

I'm probably the norm.

A good CTO job description would actually be read and have positive impact on hiring an actual CTO. It seems to be difficult to write a good, generic CTO job description because a CTO at a tiny startup is very different from a CTO at a Fortune 100 company, and so the role varies tremendously with time and context.

Most hiring managers or good recruiters engage with CTO-level candidates in-person, or at least on the phone, attempting to convey the _incredible opportunity of working with a company_ with dramatic and emotional voice-over effect. They may have been building a relationship for years by the time the job becomes available. So many job descriptions are sent as documentation or placeholders, later, for the unlikely event of the job description being shared more broadly.

A [quick search of "CTO job descriptions"](http://bfy.tw/H3TB) reveals a staggering lack of imagination, personality or voice. According to some, a CTO must have _excellent communication skills_, _a problem-solving aptitude_, _mentor team members_, and even _be proficient at Microsoft Office Suite_.

Many CTO job descriptions are kitchen sink descriptions of anything remotely technical, such as _IT_ or _maintenance of an internal ERP system_. This is often the list of everything that is currently broken or anything that has to do with computers. This makes the breakdown of responsibilities unclear, and the role very confusing.

There's no clear definition of success, but a lot of responsibilities such as _focus on innovation_ or _defining the architecture and technology vision_.

Even job descriptions at growth companies tend to assume that a CTO's career is over and focus entirely on short term problems.

Job descriptions poorly convey critical aspects of a company's leadership and often misrepresent big problems. This may include lack of trust between the technology team and the rest of the organization, or absence of cohesion or alignment in the executive team and between founder and hires.

Target compensation is unclear or varies with the experience of the candidate. One can't stop but wonder whether it also varies with the candidate's gender or origin.

Would would a more thoughtful CTO job description that addresses some of these issues entail?

Multiple colleagues suggested that a CTO job description becomes a pitch deck, similar to the one used for raising funds. It would be thoughtful and include an overview of the company, a proposal tailored to a potential CTO on the opportunity, an overview of the team, current organization and CTO's ownership, honest and clear set of expectations for the role, objectives to achieve over the next few years and a broad definition of success. The next level of detail would have a perspective on the role from the hiring manager, usually the CEO. Finally, the job would clearly set target compensation and provide a high level breakdown of salary vs. equity.

Without going as far as a deck, I would keep the job description specific. Here's an example inspired from a recent New York City series A startup. I particularly like this one because it spells clearly that the CTO owns the entire product organization and not just the technology side of it, making it quite attractive and unusual. It focuses entirely inward (public facing aspects of the job beyond reporting to investors are not a priority), doesn't mention IT (that's not part of the job), and calls out the role of Data Protection Officer (important because of the kind of business and new regulations).
