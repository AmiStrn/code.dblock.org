I moved the popular VMWareTasks C# library from CodePlex to Github.

The new home is: [https://github.com/dblock/vmwaretasks](https://github.com/dblock/vmwaretasks). There’s also a [new Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/vmwaretasks) for discussions.

I haven’t been using VMWare ESXi since their new licensing scheme started milking customers, even for API access, but it remains a great product and as far as I know most people who write C# code to talk to ESXi are using VMWareTasks. Several people have been sending patches recently, Github will make this process a lot easier.
