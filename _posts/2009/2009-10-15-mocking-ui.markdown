I stared using [Balsamiq](http://www.balsamiq.com/) recently to mock UI. This is the type of software that I am always frustrated with, asking myself "Why hasn't anyone done something like this for less than a million dollars?" and wanting to write my own. Fortunately [Balsamiq](http://www.balsamiq.com/) is totally to the point, just does the job I need it to quite well. A pleasure to work with and worth 79$.
