This morning, [Dan Croak](https://github.com/croaky), chief marketing officer at [Thoughtbot](http://thoughtbot.com/about/), has finally come forward as an amazing open-source contributor. All his previous contributions to the core Rails project notwithstanding. He submitted this to the [Heroku-Bartender project](https://github.com/sarcilav/heroku-bartender/).

This qualifies Dan as an amazing open-source contributor per [opensource.com 10 amazing open-source contributor rules](http://opensource.com/life/11/3/how-become-amazing-contributor-open-source-project), despite breaking number (3) - no unit tests were attached to the patch. Congratulations and thank you, Dan!

Even small and silly as this one, open-source contributions are very valuable. I know how excited [Sebastian](https://github.com/sarcilav) was that his first open-source project had a pull request. I know how users will love to see a cool icon in their favorites when they use Heroku-Bartender. It’s an open-source win. Go contribute something small to any open-source project – even if it’s a favicon!
