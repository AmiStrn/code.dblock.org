I’m at [QConSF 2011](https://qconsf.com/sf2011/).

The keynote was in the form of a trial with a dressed judge and witnesses. A penguin, a ball and a UML object were the accused. Brian Foote, a software ethnologist, talked about _reuse_. He argued that the American reusable space shuttle wasted a ton of energy vs. the Soviet Союз space program that left everything except a small module with cosmonauts behind. That's enough energy and metal to build out a Stanley Kubrick space wheel a mile in diameter. Joshua Kerievsky made a parallel between object inheritance and real life. Having a vasectomy to avoid having children is the kind of discipline objects could use.
