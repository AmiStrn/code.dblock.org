It takes me 30-45 seconds to load a Rails page in development. Finally someone did something about it.

[rails-dev-boost](https://github.com/thedarkone/rails-dev-boost)

The gem replaces the default reloading mechanism by something much more involved that tracks dependencies. Obviously itâ€™s a lot faster. Works with Rails 3. I feel like a human again developing UI.
