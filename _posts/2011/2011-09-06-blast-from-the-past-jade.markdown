In 1997 I wrote a program called Jade. It worked on Windows 3.1. I can’t get it to run anymore, but I got the image that would hang there until the app loaded – it says _Stolen Technologies Inc._, a name I’ve used for a couple of ears before creating _Vestris Inc._ Unlike Vestris, STI was actually never incorporated.

Jade was a personal address book manager that let me print labels of my contacts. It had some [amazing code](https://gist.github.com/1196422). I’ll buy a beer to whoever can tell me what this actually does – I certainly can’t! I am glad it didn’t work out.

I can’t believe that this was almost 15 years ago.
