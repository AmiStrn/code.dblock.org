"What would you call such an animal?", asked someone at work about a future new hire in our engineering team. A rather artsy discussion ensued – working with a bunch of creative people across art and technology disciplines often sparks fun conversations. Next thing you know I am reading [rickwebb’s tumble on engineering titles](http://rickwebb.tumblr.com/post/7938077259/whats-the-worse-piece-of-advice-youve-ever-received).

> _"That myth is that titles are bad, and people hate managers [...] then there are titles. Same deal. There are some people who don’t care about titles. God bless ‘em. There are, however, many people that do."_

I see Rick occasionally, but he’s now in another time zone! How is he reading my mind?

I used to care about titles a whole lot more when working for a big company. _"He’s a PUM!"_, someone would say. At Microsoft the title structure was pretty rigid, especially in the entry levels: one would start as a Software Design Engineer (SDE) or a Software Design Engineer in Test (SDET) to maybe become a Development Lead and finally Development Manager. Some were Distinguished Engineers. There were also Product Managers, General Managers and, finally, Product Unit Managers. It mattered when connecting with individuals across such a large company and I’d always lookup someone’s reporting structure in the directory before a meeting.

In a startup we’d like not to think about titles too much. So my creative colleagues are going wild offering new names.

#### Enginelopers and Devengeers

I watched [this excellent presentation](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Craft-and-Software-Engineering) that compared Software Engineering with other Engineering disciplines. I don’t like to think about anyone on my team as "a pair of hands" or "a brain on a stick". Software is a creative business that translates into both an artistic and a disciplined process. The word "Engineer" carries too much context around planning, architecting and thinking, while the word "Developer", not enough. Are we a new breed of "Enginelopers"?

There’s something romantic-sounding in the reverse combination of the two words. It evokes a bit of "Adventurer" and "Evangelist".

#### Seriously ...

I think Rick’s advice is pretty good.

> _My thinking now is that it’s best to acknowledge this early, and apply titles from the getgo, thus garnering the increased thanks from the employee when a title is given proactively, rather than when they’re one foot out the door and you offer it belatedly. [...] Hire and title as if you are already at a 100 people, place them where they would belong based on their merits, and fill in the gaps later._

But maybe you want to pitch in? How do you title your new Engineering hires?
