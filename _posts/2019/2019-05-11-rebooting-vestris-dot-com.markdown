I've rebooted [vestris.com](https://www.vestris.com) and have incorporated it in New York State to serve as a legal entity for my open-source projects, including the many slack bots. 

I also dug up a fun piece of Vestris history, [the original audio](/images/posts/2019/2019-05-11-rebooting-vestris-dot-com/answering-machine.mp3) from my answering machine in 1998!
