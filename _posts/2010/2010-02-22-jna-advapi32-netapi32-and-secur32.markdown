I made a code commit to [JNA](https://github.com/twall/jna/) today. Yes, I am committing Java code to an LGPL project on [java.net](https://github.com/twall/jna/). Please don't hate me. I don't want to be dodging stones, so I'll be sticking to crowded spaces and plan to take the 6 train down from Grand Central today.
