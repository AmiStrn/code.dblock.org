I really enjoy the conversation with software architects on how to make technology choices. I polled the members of the New York CTO club on the topic and got amazing war stories – I’ll keep those for later. I gave a talk on this yesterday @ [GeneralAssemb.ly](http://generalassemb.ly/). In this iteration I focused on what can go wrong in a traditional vendor evaluation approach taken by many corporations.

Have you ever been part of one of those? It goes something like this.

- **Identify Candidates** : bring in vendors that can solve your problem, on paper
- **Develop Metrics** : figure out how to compare the vendors, consider scalability, complexity and cost
- **Gather Data** : build a feature and metrics matrix
- **Compare** : SUM(A:Z)
- **Pick a Winner** : MAX(SUM(A:Z))

A bakeoff is generally worth it, but is both expensive and totally boring!

At the same time, _corrosion_ is something that plagues this kind of process through corruption (lets discuss our product over a fancy dinner) or, sometimes, pure intimidation and escalation (lets discuss our product over a fancy dinner ... with your boss).

This talk is about better, more agile options. IMO, it boils down to trusting people vs. process. Slides from my talk @GA [here](http://www.slideshare.net/dblockdotorg/making-agile-technology-choices).
