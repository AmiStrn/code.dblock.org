Community MSI Extensions is a collection of MSI custom actions and WIX extensions that extend Windows installer, originally developed by [Application Security Inc.](http://www.appsecinc.com/) for a large Enterprise product, and open-sourced in 2009. The project grew and continues growing incrementally implementing everything that WIX didn't have out of the box. All custom actions and extensions are fully unit-tested.

This release is the first one off Github, adds some small features, a number of bug fixes and is built with Wix 3.5. See the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/dblock/msiext/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for details.
