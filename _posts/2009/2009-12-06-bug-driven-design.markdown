 Customer: I want a product that does X.
Developer: Done.
 Customer: Already? But there's no icon!
Developer: Bug! Here's the icon.
 Customer: I click on an icon, nothing happens.
Developer: Bug! It now popups a window.
 Customer: But I don't see customer records in this window!
Developer: Bug! ...
```
