My [latest article on OpenSource.com](http://opensource.com/business/11/5/thinking-open-source-how-startups-destroy-culture-fear).

It mentions Heroku-Bartender, here’s a [link](https://github.com/sarcilav/heroku-bartender). Oh and yes, it’s about [Carter](http://carterac.tumblr.com) and his relentless work that creates a culture of trust and general awesomeness at [Art.sy](https://artsy.net).

I’d love to hear what you have to say!
