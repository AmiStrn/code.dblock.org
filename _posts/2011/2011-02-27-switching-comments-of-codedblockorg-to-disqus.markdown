A long time ago I used to think that coding everything myself is the way to go. Eventually the web evolved into a mash-up of simpler services that excel at what they do. Today I am switching this blog’s comments to [Disqus](http://disqus.com/). Frankly, every time the blog uses Disqus, I leave a comment. I hope this means you’ll do the same here. Click on the _Post Comment_ link above, even if it’s just to say yay!
