dotNetInstaller, aka DNI has moved to CodePlex: [http://www.codeplex.com/dotnetinstaller](http://www.codeplex.com/dotnetinstaller). I'm going to help Davide, the original author, with some coordination around the project. If you need a working setup bootstrapper for Windows now, this is it.

I also posted a 1.6 beta.

#### Update (2015)

dotNetInstaller now lives [on Github](https://github.com/dblock/dotnetinstaller).
