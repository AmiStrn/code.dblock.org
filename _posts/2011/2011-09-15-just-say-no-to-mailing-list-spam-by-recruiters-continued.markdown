... read [my previous post](/just-say-no-to-mailing-list-spam-by-recruiters) first ...

In a fantastic twist of irony a recruiter responded to the lively discussion on the MongoNYC list about whether to allow recruiters to post to the list and especially whether the name of the hiring company should appear in the posting. He posted a job for a junior C++ developer to work on MongoDB kernel. The moderator [replied](http://www.meetup.com/New-York-MongoDB-User-Group/messages/22580472/).

> _This is a perfect example of a posting I do NOT want on this list. This is a job description for an opening at my employer, 10gen, but this recruiter is not actively working with us and is clearly fishing for resumes._

Need I say more?
