Me? I am camping in the jungle, betting my lunch on MongoDB!

Few remember how Oracle came to dominate the database market - it was a thousand million years ago. A lot was being said about the technical excellence of Ingres in those years – and the truth is that Ingres was technologically superior on so many levels. Oracle spent mountains on aggressive advertising, sales and customer acquisition. And they used the money to enable their customers to be successful by hiring the best database engineers. Most of today’s developers don’t even know what Ingres is.

10gen has now raised enough funding to possibly repeat Oracle’s story with a document store. Oracle clearly feels threatened. So from here to the near term future MongoDB is only going to get better with relatively little legacy to worry about. As a customer spending money on MongoDB I think it’s a great place to be – the MongoDB release cycle is very short and release after release we’re seeing increased reliability, better performance and all the features we’d ever want from a conceptually more suitable data store to the kinds of problems we deal with now.
