Had a blast presenting the [GA open-source Ruby-on-Rails curriculum](https://github.com/generalassembly/ga-ruby-on-rails-for-devs) at the New York Times open source science fair last week. We now have community-contributed translations into [Spanish](https://github.com/generalassembly/ga-ruby-on-rails-for-devs/tree/spanish) and [Chinese](https://github.com/transist/ga-ruby-on-rails-for-devs/tree/chinese) and the project keeps growing. The crowd genuinely enjoyed the baking soda and vinegar volcano inspired by [@madsgo](https://twitter.com/MadsGo), too.

Hereâ€™s a blog post about all the exhibitors: [http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/21/open-source-science-fair-exhibitor-experiences/](http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/21/open-source-science-fair-exhibitor-experiences). The fair was followed by three excellent talks by [@jashkenas](https://twitter.com/jashkenas) on canvas tricks, [@rmurphey](https://twitter.com/rmurphy) on hacking Adruino with JavaScript and [@holman](https://twitter.com/holman) about the mission of open sourcing. I even dug up my [opensource.com](http://opensource.com/) anniversary T-shirt for the event, for which I earned a whoopee cushion that my son played with for hours.
