A recording of me speaking at MongoNYC 2012.

My [next talk is at GoRuCo, the Gotham Ruby Conference](http://goruco.com/). Weâ€™ll take a Grape API from zero to cache in 10 minutes. The [lineup of speakers](http://goruco.com/speakers/) is pretty intimidating, ranging from Dr. Nic Williams to David Chelimsky.
