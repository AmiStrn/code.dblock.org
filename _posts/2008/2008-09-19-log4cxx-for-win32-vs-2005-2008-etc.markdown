[This guy](http://www.dreamcubes.com/blog) just saved me tons of time. I've spent two days on a handle leak that I eventually tracked down to an older version of log4cxx that we have been using. Upgrading to log4cxx 10 was really easy with pre-built binaries and Visual Studio projects that he provided.

Thank you!
