I recently [worked on bringing Artsy to Amazon Echo, Alexa](http://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/11/30/bringing-artsy-to-amazon-echo-alexa) and decided to hack something less serious.

Two Echo dots are better than one. They are aware of each-other, so only one will pickup a command when in proximity with the other and on the same WiFi network. Alexa can also say its name, so we can make these talk! _Alexa, ask mom to buy me an elephant!_ ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J03y1cln-Dw)).

I also made another skill called _The Future of Amerika_, now available in your official skills, that quotes Donald Trump making America great again ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0-mN8VgZ34)).
