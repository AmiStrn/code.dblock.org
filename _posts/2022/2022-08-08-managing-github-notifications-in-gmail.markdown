My e-mail inbox is flooded with GitHub notifications, just like yours.

Having tried half a dozen ways to get a queue of notifications, I settled on creating a filter and use it to label the email, and remove it from the inbox, the first time I receive a new notification for a repo I am subscribed to on GitHub.

Then I check those emails in bulk and never miss anything.
