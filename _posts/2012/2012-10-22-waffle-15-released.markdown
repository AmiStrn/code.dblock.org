WAFFLE is a native Windows Authentication Framework consisting of two C# and Java libraries that perform functions related to Windows authentication, supporting Negotiate, NTLM and Kerberos. Waffle also includes libraries that enable drop-in Windows Single Sign On for popular Java web servers, when running on Windows.

This is a pretty big release and includes patches and features by 5 contributors, thank you! See the [complete CHANGELOG](https://github.com/dblock/waffle/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for details.
