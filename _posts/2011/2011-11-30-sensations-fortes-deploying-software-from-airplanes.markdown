I remember bringing a 14Kbps modem from the U.S. back to Europe in mid-nineties. I couldn’t wait to stick it into the ISA slot on my 486 and was underestimating how much trouble it was going to be to occupy my parent’s phone line all the time or discussing the phone bill at the end of the month. Things have changed in 15 years – we finally have Internet on airplanes for about ten bucks a flight.

So I just redeployed our production site with a few minor bug fixes from my seat on a Delta flight to Miami – going to Art Basel with the entire Art.sy team!
