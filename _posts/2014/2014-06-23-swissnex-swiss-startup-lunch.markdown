I had the pleasure and privilege of talking about my startup experiences in Switzerland in the 90s and more recently at [Artsy](http://artsy.net) in New York at a lunch organized by [Swissnex](http://www.swissnex.org/). The amount of companies solving real problems in that room was quite impressive, ranging from biotech to robotics. Not a single social network, mostly serious entrepreneurs, the real deal. I talked mostly about people, including a reference [to T-Shaped skills](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills).
