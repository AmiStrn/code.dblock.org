I took a deep breath, and released Grape Framework 1.0. We're at 8,066 Github stars and 965 forks. I still think Grape is the best way to build Ruby RESTful APIs. I've [written many blog posts](/tags/grape/) on the subject.

Some of the big changes in 1.0 included [ripping out Hashie::Mash](https://github.com/ruby-grape/grape/pull/1594) and [multi_xml and multi_json](https://github.com/ruby-grape/grape/pull/1623). As always we took great care of preserving as much backwards compatibility as possible.

Enjoy!
