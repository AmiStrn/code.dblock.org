I’ve written about delay-processing certain image versions in [this article](http://code.dblock.org/carrierwave-delayjob-processing-of-selected-versions). We’ve made some progress since with a much more robust implementation. Check out [this new post](http://artsy.github.com/blog/2012/01/31/delaying-carrierwave-image-processing/) on the Art.sy Engineering blog.
