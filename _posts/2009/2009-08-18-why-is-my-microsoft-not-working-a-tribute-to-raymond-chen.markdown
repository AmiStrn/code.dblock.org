I was reading [Raymond Chen's "The Old New Thing"](http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing) on my way home in the NY subway yesterday. I met Raymond once @ MSFT, and he probably doesn't remember me, but over the last few years I came to realize that I really enjoy his blog. Most of his posts are related to some old or new technology but put in a more humanly digestible context. Hence, [You can use Coke as your password, but not a Pepsi one](http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/07/02/9812315.aspx).

So, in a classic tribute I have my own little story. All names are fictional.

```
Them: My Microsoft is not working. It says my license is expired.
  Me: When you right click on the little icon on the bottom right
      of the screen, and choose Help -> About, what do you see?
Them: I see "Power Options" and "Show System Icons", I don't see Help -> About.
  Me: Try again, when you right click on the little icon that looks like a
      little face on the bottom right of the screen, what do you see?
Them: Oh now I see Help -> About!
  Me: What does it say?
Them: It says that my license has expired.
  Me: Buy a new license.
Them: Thank you, you're so helpful.
```

This thread is enfuriating. I mostly hate when people call software by the company name that produces it. I think it's the fault of the auto industry after-all, everybody calls their Toyota a Toyota.
