There was a time when having multiple e-mail accounts was some kind of a pipe dream. Since I had more than one, I had to deal with [Eudora](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudora_(e-mail_client)) that wouldn't allow me to have more than one on my Windows 3.11. So I wrote [SLMRA](https://web.archive.org/web/20040222161209/http://www.vestris.com/software/slmra.html).

#### Update (2015)

I took the software down and replaced links above with archive.org's. It has been another six years, time to retire these things.
