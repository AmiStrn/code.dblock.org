Had a blast presenting the [GA open-source Ruby-on-Rails curriculum](https://github.com/dblock/ga-ruby-on-rails-for-devs) at the New York Times open source science fair last week. We now have community-contributed translations into Spanish and Chinese (sadly, probably lost when GeneralAssemb.ly deleted their GitHub repo) and the project keeps growing. The crowd genuinely enjoyed the baking soda and vinegar volcano inspired by [@madsgo](https://twitter.com/MadsGo), too.

Hereâ€™s a blog post about all the exhibitors: [https://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/21/open-source-science-fair-exhibitor-experiences/](https://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/21/open-source-science-fair-exhibitor-experiences). The fair was followed by three excellent talks by [@jashkenas](https://twitter.com/jashkenas) on canvas tricks, [@rmurphey](https://twitter.com/rmurphy) on hacking Adruino with JavaScript and [@holman](https://twitter.com/holman) about the mission of open sourcing. I even dug up my [opensource.com](https://opensource.com/) anniversary T-shirt for the event, for which I earned a whoopee cushion that my son played with for hours.
